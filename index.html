        			  Hawai'i's population is very diverse and has a different lifestyle compared to
                anywhere else in the world, but just how unique is the population compared to
                the rest of the United States? This is the question we are trying to answer while
                we are analyzing Hawai'i's demographics. In order to answer this question, we've
                come up with <a href="viz.html">four sub questions</a> that will hopefully help
                us discover just how unique the population is.

        			<h4 align="center">How does the median age and male to female ratio in Hawai'i
                stack up against the USA?</h4>
        			<p class="summary text" align="center" style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 2%;">
        			  This small amount of data managed to tell us a bit about the people of Hawai'i.
                Hawai'i generally has a higher percentage of older people when compared to the rest
                of the United States. This was shown in both a higher percentage of older people
                and a higher median age. In regards to gender, there wasn't much of a difference
                between the male to female ratio in Hawai'i vs the male to female ratio in the country;
                however, both showed a slight favor towards females. <br>To see the full analysis,

        			<h4 align="center">Is Hawai'i diverse when compared to the rest of the USA?</h4>
        			<p class="summary text" align="center" style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 2%;">
        			  Hawai'i's population has shown a much larger diversity in race when compared to the USA.
                Hawai'i has a very large percentage of Asians, but with so many different races in the
                Asian category, we can conclude that this just further adds to the fact that Hawai'i
                has a diverse population. This diversity can also be reflected in the languages spoken
                in Hawai'i vs the United States. Although English is the dominant language spoken in
                both Hawai'i and the United States, Hawai'i has a large amount of Asian and Pacific
                Island languages spoken. These 2 categories, although grouped together, can be
                broken up into several different languages. <br>To see the full analysis, click

        			<h4 align="center">Does education affect the income and types of jobs available in Hawai'i?</h4>
        			<p class="summary text" align="center" style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 2%;">
        			  Across the state, a majority of Hawai'i's population stops going to school after
                obtaining a high school diploma; however, Hawai'i has a much higher percent of high
                school graduates attempting to gain a college degree compared to the US. Although
                gender does not seem to play a significant part in one's ability to get a college
                degree, race does seem to play a role in it, whether it's intentional or not. The
                level of education one gains though does seem to play a role in one's income and
                jobs available to them. Across the state, it is seen that with a higher education
                status, there tends to be a higher employment rate, a lower poverty rate, and higher
                income. Compared to the national average, Hawai'i's population seems to have a higher
                employment rate no matter what their education status is. However, it does seem that to
                be at least equal with the national average in income, a person in Hawai'i should have
                at least attempted to get a college degree. <br>To see the full analysis, click

        			<h4 align="center">How does Hawai'i compare to USA housing?</h4>

        			<p class="summary text" align="center" style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 2%;">
        			  It is well known that Hawai'i has a very high cost of living. Thus, for this specific
                analysis, we compared Hawai'i to both the Unites States as well as New York, another
                state known for having a high cost of living. Hawai'i has a larger percentage of
                married household owners compared to the rest of the nation, including New York.
                This could be due to more relaxed and "aloha" lifestyle here in Hawai'i. However,
                what's interesting to see is that less households in Hawai'i actually own their
                property compared to the nation, although the percentage is still higher than New York.
                This could indicate that with a higher population density, there is less land to own,
                thus the cost of owning the property is higher and less abundant. This is also shown
                in the household structure type where a majority of the household types are single-units
                vs a multi-unit home. Of course, cost is a big factor when comparing housing values.
                Hawai'i has shown that it has a much larger percentage of homes over $500k, with more
                than half the homes in Hawai'i being over $500k. In New York, there is only a
                little more than a fourth of the homes being over $500k; this shows that Hawai'i's
                housing cost is way above that of the United States. <br>To see the full analysis,

        			<h4 align="center">So, just how unique is Hawai'i's Population?</h4>

        			<p class="summary text" align="center" style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 2%;">
        			  As you can see from the different data sets, Hawai'i's population is very unique
                in many different ways. The people here have a higher median age, plenty of racial
                and cultural diversity, varied levels of education, income, and job opportunities,
                and a unique housing market. There really isn't another place that can come close
                to the diversity and the way people live here, both good and bad.
