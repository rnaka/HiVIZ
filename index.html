        			Hawaii's population is very diverse and has a different lifestyle compared to anywhere else in the world, but just how unique is the population compared to the rest of the United States? This is the question we are trying to answer while we are analyzing Hawaii's demographic. In order to answer this question, we've come up with <a href="viz.html">four sub questions</a> that will hopefully help us discover just how unique the population is. 
        			</p>
        			
        			<h4 align="center">How does the median age and male to female ratio in Hawaii stack up against the USA?</h4>
        			<p class="summary text" align="center" style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 2%;">  
        			This small amount of data had managed to tell us a bit about the people of Hawaii. Hawaii generally has a higher percentage of older people when compared to the rest of the United States. This was shown in both a higher percentage of older people and a higher median age. In regards to gender, there wasn't much of a difference between the male to female ratio in Hawaii vs the male to female ratio in the country, however, both showed a slight favor towards females. <br>To see the full analysis, click <a href="ageAndSex.html">here</a>.
        			</p>
        			
        			<h4 align="center">Is Hawaii diverse when compared to the rest of the USA?</h4>
        			<p class="summary text" align="center" style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 2%;">  
        			Hawaii's population has shown a much larger diversity in race when compared to the USA. Hawaii has a very large percentage of Asians, but with so many different races in the Asian category, we can conclude that this just further adds to the fact that Hawaii has a diverse population. This diversity can also be reflected in the languages spoken in Hawaii vs the United States. Although English is the dominant language spoken in both Hawaii and in the United States, Hawaii has a large amount of Asian and Pacific island languages spoken. These 2 categories, although grouped together, can be broken up into several different languages. <br>To see the full analysis, click <a href="raceLang.html">here</a>.
        			</p>
        			
        			<h4 align="center">Does education affect the income and types of jobs available in Hawaii?</h4>
        			<p class="summary text" align="center" style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 2%;">  
        			Across the state, a majority of Hawaii's population stops going to school after obtaining a high school diploma, however, Hawaii has a much higher percent of high school graduates attempting to gain a college degree compared to the US. Although gender does not seem to play a significant part in one's ability to get a college degree, race does seem to play a role in it, whether it's intentional or not. The level of education one gains though does seem to play a role in one's income and jobs available to them. Across the state, it is seen that with a higher education status, there tends to be a higher employment rate, a lower poverty rate, and higher income. Compared to the national average, Hawaii's population seems to have a higher employment rate no matter their education status is. However, it does seem that to be at least equal with the national average on income, a person in hawaii should have at least attempted to get a college degree. <br>To see the full analysis, click <a href="educationIncomeOccupation.html">here</a>.
        			</p>
        			
        			<h4 align="center">How does Hawaii compare to USA housing?</h4>
        			
        			<p class="summary text" align="center" style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 2%;">  
        			It is well known that Hawaii has a very high cost of living. Thus, for this specific analysis, we compared Hawaii to both the Unites States as well as New York, another state known for having a high cost of living. Hawaii has a larger percentage of married household owners compared to the rest of the nation, including New York. This could be due to more relaxed and "aloha" lifestyle here in Hawaii. However, what's interesting to see is that less households in Hawaii actually own their property compared to the nation, although the percentage is still higher than New York. This could indicate that with a higher population density, there is less land to own, thus the cost of owning the property is higher and less abundant. This is also shown in the household structure type where a majority of the household types are single-units vs a multi-unit home. Of course, cost is a big factor when comparing housing values. Hawaii has shown that it has a much larger percentage of homes over $500k, with more than half the homes in Hawaii being over $500k. Compared to New York, where only a little more than a fourth of the homes being over $500k, this shows that Hawaii's housing cost is way above that of the United States. <br>To see the full analysis, click <a href="populationByHousehold.html">here</a>.
        			</p>
        			
        			<h4 align="center">So, just how unique is Hawaii's Population?</h4>
        			
        			<p class="summary text" align="center" style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 2%;">  
        			As you can see from the different data sets, Hawaii's population is very unique in many different ways. The people here have a higher median age, plenty of racial and cultural diversity, varied levels of education, income, and job opportunities, and a unique housing market. There really isn't another place that can come close to the diversity and the way people live here, both good and bad.
