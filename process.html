          This document is the original brainstorming behind our idea. For our ICS 484 class, we were tasked
          to create an interactive visualization based on data that we hand picked ourselves. In this
          document, we come up with our team name and compile a quick introduction of the members. We also
          decide what datasets we want to focus on (Demographics of Hawai'i) and we initially link some
          sites that contain relevant data towards our topic.

              This is the first version of our Miro Board. This Miro Board is basically where our team
              planned out the layout of our site. Initially, we were going to have three main pages: the
              home page, the visualizations page, and the datasets page. The home page would contain what
              questions we were looking to answer as well as a short about us section for others to learn
              about our team. <br/><br/>

              For the visualizations page, we planned to have a nice layout and have links to each of the
              separate visualization pages via this page. As you can see, the topics we chose were age and
              sex, income, education, & occupation type, race & ethnicity, and housing cost & types. For
              the datasets page, we just planned to have a separate page for reference to show users where
              our data was retrieved from with links to the different sites. <br/><br/>

              This is the second version of our Miro Board. As you can see, there are a couple of
              changes as compared to the previous version. For the home page, we decided to remove the
              about us section and save it for its own page. We also decided to come up with our title
              for this project to give users a good idea of what we are trying to accomplish. We also
              wanted to give users a short explanation of the visualizations. <br/><br/>

              We changed the visualizations page to the questions page but it serves the same purpose,
              just with a different name. We also decided that it would be nice to have a separate page
              for the about us section like what was mentioned above as it is not relevant for the title
              page but we still wanted users to get an idea of the members in the team. Another new page
              we decided to add was the process page, which is this current page. We added this to give
              others a sense of the brainstorming and planning that went into this project. It also
              allows users to see how our ideas developed into the final product. <br/><br/>
